# Aztec Network Overview

Raven House is built on Aztec Network, a layer 2 privacy platform that enables confidential and efficient transactions on Ethereum.

## What is Aztec Network?

Aztec Network is a privacy-focused layer 2 blockchain that uses zero-knowledge proofs to enable private transactions on Ethereum. It allows applications to benefit from both the security of Ethereum and the privacy features of zero-knowledge cryptography.

Key characteristics of Aztec Network include:

- **Privacy-first**: Built from the ground up to enable confidential transactions
- **ZK-Rollup**: Uses zero-knowledge rollups for scalability and low fees
- **Noir Language**: Custom programming language for zero-knowledge applications
- **EVM Compatibility**: Works with Ethereum while adding privacy features

## How Raven House Uses Aztec

Raven House leverages Aztec's privacy features to provide benefits that traditional NFT marketplaces can't offer:

1. **Private NFT Ownership**: Shield your NFT ownership from public view
2. **Confidential Transfers**: Transfer NFTs without revealing transaction details
3. **Lower Gas Costs**: Benefit from layer 2 scaling through ZK-rollups
4. **Secure Authentication**: Use zero-knowledge proofs for verification without revealing sensitive data

{/* ## Aztec Account Structure

Aztec uses a different account structure than standard Ethereum addresses:

- **Aztec Address**: Addresses start with `aztec:` followed by the network ID and actual address
- **Account Types**: Different account types support various privacy features
- **Key Management**: Managed through compatible wallets like Azguard

When using Raven House, your Aztec address will be used for all transactions and NFT operations. */}

## Zero-Knowledge Proofs

At the core of Aztec are zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs), which allow one party to prove to another that a statement is true without revealing any information beyond the validity of the statement itself.

In the context of NFTs:

- A ZKP can prove you own an NFT without revealing which NFT
- A ZKP can verify a transfer happened without revealing the specific details
- A ZKP can confirm eligibility without exposing your entire collection

## Notes and Nullifiers

Aztec uses a note-based system for privacy:

- **Notes**: Encrypted records that represent ownership of assets
- **Nullifiers**: Prevent double-spending while maintaining privacy
- **Viewing Keys**: Allow selective disclosure to authorized parties

When you own an NFT privately on Raven House, it's stored as a note that only you can decrypt and prove ownership of.

## Noir Language

Noir is a domain-specific language for writing zero-knowledge circuits, used to develop the smart contracts for Raven House.

Key features:

- **Aztec-native**: Designed specifically for the Aztec ecosystem
- **Circuit-friendly**: Optimized for creating efficient zero-knowledge proofs
- **Security-focused**: Helps developers avoid common pitfalls

The NFT contracts on Raven House are written in Noir to leverage the full privacy capabilities of Aztec.
