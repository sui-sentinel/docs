# Privacy Features Explained

Raven House leverages Aztec Network's zero-knowledge proof technology to offer advanced privacy features for NFT trading.

## Understanding Privacy in NFTs

Traditional NFT marketplaces operate on transparent blockchains where all transactions are visible to everyone. Raven House changes this paradigm by offering:

- **Privacy-preserving transactions**: Hide transfer details from public view
- **Confidential ownership**: Shield your NFT holdings
{/* - **Private bids and offers**: Keep your interests private */}
{/* - **Selective disclosure**: Choose what information to reveal */}
## How Privacy Works on Raven House

### Zero-Knowledge Proofs

Raven House uses zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) through the Aztec Network to enable privacy. ZKPs allow one party to prove to another that a statement is true without revealing any information beyond the validity of the statement itself.

For NFTs, this means:

- You can prove you own an NFT without revealing which NFT
- You can transfer an NFT without making the transaction public
- You can verify eligibility for airdrops or whitelists without exposing your entire wallet

### Public vs Private State

NFTs on Raven House can exist in two states:

**Public State**:
- Visible on the blockchain
- Similar to traditional NFTs
- Full transparency of ownership and transfers

**Private State**:
- Ownership information is shielded
- Transfers are confidential
- Only the owner can prove ownership

## Privacy Features in Practice

### Private NFT Transfers

When transferring an NFT privately:

1. The transaction details are encrypted
2. Zero-knowledge proofs verify the validity of the transfer
3. The NFT moves to the recipient's private balance
4. No public record of the specific NFT transferred is created

{/* ### Privacy-Preserving Verification

For Discord role verification:

1. The user connects their wallet to the verification system
2. Zero-knowledge proofs verify NFT ownership without revealing which specific NFTs they own
3. The verification system confirms eligibility without accessing the user's full wallet data
4. The appropriate Discord role is assigned

### Selective Disclosure

Users can choose to:

- Keep their entire NFT collection private
- Make some NFTs public while keeping others private
- Reveal ownership of specific NFTs for verification purposes
- Toggle between public and private states as needed */}

- **Viewing keys**: Allow selective disclosure to authorized parties
- **Zero-knowledge circuits**: Validate transactions without revealing data */}

## Privacy Considerations

While Raven House provides strong privacy guarantees, users should be aware of:

- **Metadata leakage**: Information outside the blockchain may reveal ownership
- **Correlation risks**: Patterns of activity may still be observable
- **Regulatory compliance**: Privacy features are designed for legitimate use cases, not to circumvent regulations */}
