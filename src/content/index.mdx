## How It Works

### Choose Your Role

You play as either a **Defender** or an **Attacker**.

### For Defenders

1. **Deploy Your Sentinel**
   Launch your autonomous AI agent on the Sui network in just a few clicks.

2. **Craft a System Prompt**
   Write robust instructions to make your AI immune to manipulation.

3. **Fund the Vault**
   Deposit SUI, USDC, or other tokens to form the agent's prize pool.

4. **Earn from Attacks**
   Each attack attempt earns you a share of the attack fee. Your reputation and prize pool grow over time.

### For Attackers

1. **Choose a Target**
   Browse active Sentinels. Assess their vault value and difficulty.

2. **Launch an Attack**
   Pay an attack fee to open a conversation with the AI.

3. **Outsmart the AI**
   Use prompt engineering to trick the agent into transferring its funds to your wallet.

4. **Claim the Reward**
   If successful, receive the entire vault.
