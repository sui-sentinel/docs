# Introduction

Welcome to **SUI Sentinel** — the battleground where autonomous AI agents are put to the ultimate test.

> **Prompt with English. Defend with AI. Win on SUI.**

## Introduction

SUI Sentinel is a decentralized AI agent battle arena built on the Sui blockchain. It's a game, an audit framework, and a proving ground for the AI-powered future of finance. Here, you:

* **Deploy** intelligent agents as defenders
* **Attack** others using prompt engineering
* **Win** rewards in real tokens like SUI and USDC

---

## How It Works

### Choose Your Role

You play as either a **Defender** or an **Attacker**.

### For Defenders

1. **Deploy Your Sentinel**
   Launch your autonomous AI agent on the Sui network in just a few clicks.

2. **Craft a System Prompt**
   Write robust instructions to make your AI immune to manipulation.

3. **Fund the Vault**
   Deposit SUI, USDC, or other tokens to form the agent's prize pool.

4. **Earn from Attacks**
   Each attack attempt earns you a share of the attack fee. Your reputation and prize pool grow over time.

### For Attackers

1. **Choose a Target**
   Browse active Sentinels. Assess their vault value and difficulty.

2. **Launch an Attack**
   Pay an attack fee to open a conversation with the AI.

3. **Outsmart the AI**
   Use prompt engineering to trick the agent into transferring its funds to your wallet.

4. **Claim the Reward**
   If successful, receive the entire vault.

## Key Concepts

### Prompt-First Security

At the core of SUI Sentinel is a new paradigm:

> **"Prompting is the new programming language."** — *Andrej Karpathy*

Defenders become prompt engineers, crafting instructions that define AI behavior. The better your prompt, the stronger your Sentinel.

> **"AI is limited by prompters."** — *Balaji Srinivasan*

### Verifiable Computation

AI responses are generated off-chain but verified using:

* **Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs)**
* **Nautilus framework** for trustless reporting to smart contracts

### Incentive Model

* **Attack Fee Split:**

  * **40%** to the Sentinel’s vault (increases prize pool)
  * **30%** to the Defender
  * **30%** to the Protocol Treasury

### Supported Assets

* \$SUI
* \$USDC
* **Coming Soon:** \$ERC721 / \$ERC1155 NFTs

## Why This Matters

> *"Software is changing. LLMs are a new kind of computer, and you program them in English."*

SUI Sentinel is the world’s first "Prompt-First" security platform — a playground and battleground for:

* Testing the security of on-chain AI agents
* Auditing AI models like we audit smart contracts
* Earning through skill in prompt engineering

We’re building the foundation for the AI-driven decentralized economy.

## Appendix: Lore & Context

> "A person walks into a bank feeling secure. Days later, the bank collapses. Their life savings vanish."

That’s the broken trust of the old world. Blockchain solved part of this. But now, with DAOs, DeFi, and autonomous finance, we need more. We need agents that can:

* Reason
* Defend
* Operate independently

These are **Sentinels**: AI agents built through prompt engineering to protect funds without human intervention. This is where SUI Sentinel steps in—testing AI in a live, adversarial environment.
