- **Always Current**: Web-based deployment means immediate access to Aztec updates
- **No Installation**: Works directly in your browser
- **Secure Authentication**: Uses passkeys for enhanced security
- **Built-in Faucet**: Easy access to testnet tokens
- **Developer Friendly**: Optional developer mode for testing

## Step 1: Create Your Obsidion Account

### Access the Application

1. Navigate to [app.obsidion.xyz](https://app.obsidion.xyz)
2. If this is your first visit, you'll see account creation options
3. **Important**: Ignore the "Sign in with Google" prompt for now
4. Click **"Create Account With Passkey"**

### Account Creation Process

The account creation will take a few minutes. **Do not close the window** during this process.

Behind the scenes, Obsidion is:
- Simulating the transaction
- Generating the witness for the circuit
- Proving the account creation in the PXE
- Sending the transaction and waiting for it to be mined

### Account Types

**Standard Passkey Account**:
- Uses passkey authentication for security
- Requires passkey confirmation for transactions
- Recommended for regular use

**Developer Account** (Optional):
- Check the "developer account" checkbox during creation
- Creates a passkey-less account with no transaction signature validation
- No passkey required for transactions
- Suitable for devices that don't support passkeys
- Ideal for development and testing

### Successful Creation

Once your account is created successfully, you'll see a confirmation modal. You're now ready to use your Obsidion account!

## Step 2: Get Testnet Tokens

### Claim Faucet Tokens
{/* //TODO Improve this and add faucet token screenshot */}
1. After account creation, look for the **"Claim faucet tokens"** button
2. Click this button to start the faucet process
3. **Note**: Sometimes the faucet may not work immediately - try again after a few minutes if needed

You should receive approximately 3 ETH testnet tokens.

### Convert Private Tokens to Public

**Important**: Faucet tokens are received as private tokens by default. To use them on Raven House, you need to make them public.
{/* TODO: Add multiple screenshots here to demonstrate what's going on */}
1. Click the **"Send funds"** button in your Obsidion wallet
2. A right sidebar will appear for sending funds
3. Select **"Private to Public"** transfer type
4. Paste your own wallet address as the recipient
5. Enter the amount you want to convert
6. Confirm the transaction

Your tokens are now public and ready to use on Raven House!

## Step 3: Connect to Raven House

1. Visit [Raven House](https://app.ravenhouse.xyz)
2. Click **"Connect Wallet"** in the top right corner
3. Select **"Obsidion"** from the wallet options
4. Complete the connection process
5. Your wallet address will appear in the header once connected

## Account Management

### Email Registration (Optional)

You can optionally add your email to Obsidion's Email Registry:

1. Click "Sign in with Google" in the top right corner
2. This enables sending funds to other users via email addresses
3. Learn more in the [Obsidion documentation](https://docs.obsidion.xyz)

### Security Tips

- Consider using developer mode only for testing
- Regular accounts provide better security for mainnet use

## Troubleshooting

### Account Creation Taking Too Long
- Ensure stable internet connection
- Don't close the browser window
- Wait up to 10 minutes for completion

### Faucet Not Working
- Try again after 5-10 minutes
- Check if you've already claimed recently
- Verify you're on the correct testnet

### Connection Issues with Raven House

- Clear browser cache
- Ensure you're on the same network in both apps
