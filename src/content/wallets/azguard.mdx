# Setting Up Azguard Wallet

Azguard is a Chrome extension wallet for the Aztec Network. It provides a familiar browser extension experience similar to MetaMask.

## Why Choose Azguard?

- **Browser Extension**: Convenient access from your browser toolbar
- **Traditional Security**: Password-based authentication
- **Extension Convenience**: Always accessible while browsing
- **Familiar UX**: Similar to popular wallets like MetaMask

## Important Notice

⚠️ **Testnet Compatibility**: Azguard may occasionally have compatibility issues with the latest Aztec testnet versions. The Aztec team frequently updates testnets, and while Obsidion can deploy updates immediately, Azguard requires Chrome Web Store approval which can take up to a week.

If you encounter issues, consider using [Obsidion wallet](/wallets/obsidion) as an alternative.

## Step 1: Install Azguard Extension

### Download from Chrome Web Store

1. Visit the [Azguard Wallet Chrome Extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/azguard-wallet/pliilpflcmabdiapdeihifihkbdfnbmn?hl=en&authuser=0)
2. Click **"Add to Chrome"**
3. Confirm the installation when prompted
4. The Azguard icon will appear in your browser toolbar

## Step 2: Create Your Wallet Profile

### Initial Setup

1. Click the Azguard extension icon in your browser toolbar
2. You'll see the main screen with two options:
   - **Create Profile** (for new users)
   - **Import Profile** (if you have an existing wallet)

### Create New Profile

1. Click **"Create Profile"** for your first-time setup
2. You'll be prompted to create a strong password
3. **Important**: Remember this password - you'll need it to unlock your wallet
4. Your wallet automatically locks after 5-10 minutes of inactivity

### Complete Setup

1. After setting your password, you'll see the dashboard screen
2. **Testnet** will be selected by default
3. Your account is now ready to use

## Step 3: Connect to Raven House

1. Visit [Raven House](https://app.ravenhouse.xyz)
2. Click **"Connect Wallet"** in the top right corner
3. Select **"Azguard"** from the wallet options
4. Approve the connection in the Azguard extension popup
5. Your wallet address will appear in the header once connected

{/* ## Getting Testnet Tokens

Unlike Obsidion, Azguard doesn't have a built-in faucet. You'll need to:

1. Get your Azguard wallet address from the extension
2. Use an external Aztec testnet faucet
3. Or ask for tokens in the [Raven House Discord](https://discord.com/invite/gCPZhWBYQH) */}

## Wallet Management

### Unlocking Your Wallet

- Your wallet locks automatically after 5-10 minutes

### Security Best Practices

- Use a strong, unique password
- Don't share your password with anyone
- Consider backing up your wallet data

## Troubleshooting

### Extension Not Appearing
