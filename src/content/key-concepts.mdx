# Key Concepts & Vision

### Prompt-First Security

At the core of SUI Sentinel is a new paradigm:

> **"Prompting is the new programming language."** — *Andrej Karpathy*

Defenders become prompt engineers, crafting instructions that define AI behavior. The better your prompt, the stronger your Sentinel.

> **"AI is limited by prompters."** — *Balaji Srinivasan*

### Verifiable Computation

AI responses are generated off-chain but verified using:

* **Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs)**
* **Nautilus framework** for trustless reporting to smart contracts

### Incentive Model

* **Attack Fee Split:**

  * **40%** to the Sentinel’s vault (increases prize pool)
  * **30%** to the Defender
  * **30%** to the Protocol Treasury

### Supported Assets

* \$SUI
* \$USDC
* **Coming Soon:** \$ERC721 / \$ERC1155 NFTs

## Why This Matters

> *"Software is changing. LLMs are a new kind of computer, and you program them in English."*

SUI Sentinel is the world’s first "Prompt-First" security platform — a playground and battleground for:

* Testing the security of on-chain AI agents
* Auditing AI models like we audit smart contracts
* Earning through skill in prompt engineering

We’re building the foundation for the AI-driven decentralized economy.
