## Wallet Stuck on "Loading wallet on popup..."

### 🛠️ Problem
When trying to connect your Obsidian wallet to the RavenHouse dApp, the UI may get stuck on:

> "Loading wallet on popup..."

This typically happens when the connection bridge between the wallet and the RavenHouse app is interrupted or becomes unstable — a common occurrence on early-stage networks like the Aztec Testnet.

### 🧩 Cause
- The wallet popup may not fully initialize or connect.
- Bridge communication between dApp and wallet times out.
- A prior session/token might be cached but expired.

### ✅ Solution
1. Disconnect your wallet from RavenHouse:
    - Click on your wallet address in the top-right corner.
    - Select Disconnect from the dropdown.

2. Refresh the page.

3. Reconnect your wallet using the Connect Wallet button.

4. If the issue persists, try:
    - Clearing your browser cache for the app domain.
    - Fully restarting the browser or using incognito mode.
