# Minting and Managing NFTs

This guide covers how to mint NFTs in your collections and manage them on Raven House.

## Understanding NFT States

NFTs on Raven House can exist in different states:

- **Not Minted**: NFT metadata exists in the collection but hasn't been minted on-chain yet
- **Minted**: NFT exists on the Aztec blockchain and has an owner
- **Listed**: Minted NFT that's available for purchase on the marketplace
- **Private**: NFT owned privately using zero-knowledge proofs

## Minting NFTs

1. Navigate to any collection page
2. Browse the available NFTs in the collection
3. Click on an unminted NFT (shows "Not minted yet" badge and price)
4. In the NFT details modal, review the NFT details and traits
5. Click "Mint This NFT" 
6. Confirm the transaction in your wallet
7. Wait for the minting process to complete

The minting process involves:
- Processing the payment (in USDC)
- Uploading metadata to IPFS (if not already uploaded)
- Creating the NFT on-chain
- Transferring ownership to your wallet

Once minted, the NFT will appear in your profile and the "Not minted yet" badge will be removed.



### How Collection Owners Add NFTs

Collection owners can add NFTs to their collections in two ways:

#### During Collection Creation (Step 2)
- Upload a ZIP file with images and metadata during the collection creation process
- This allows adding multiple NFTs at once before launching the collection

#### After Collection Launch  
- Use the "Upload Collection Metadata" feature on the collection page
- Upload a ZIP file containing new NFTs to add to the existing collection

Both methods use the same ZIP file format with an images folder and metadata.json file as described in the [Collections Guide](/guides/collections).
