# Using Privacy Features

This guide demonstrates how to leverage the privacy features on Raven House when working with your NFTs.

## Public vs Private NFTs

Raven House allows NFTs to exist in two states:

### Public NFTs
- Visible on the blockchain explorer
- Ownership is publicly known
- Similar to traditional NFTs

### Private NFTs
- Ownership information is shielded
- Only you can see and manage these NFTs
- Transfers remain confidential

## Transferring NFTs Privately

To transfer an NFT with privacy:

1. Navigate to the NFT detail page
2. Click "Transfer NFT"
3. In the transfer modal, select "Private" as the transfer type
4. Enter the recipient's address
5. Confirm the transaction

## Privacy in Discord Verification

When using Discord verification with private NFTs:

1. The verification process can check your private NFT balance
2. It verifies ownership without revealing which specific NFTs you own
3. You get the role without exposing your collection

## Best Practices for Privacy

{/* ### Keep Collections Private

For maximum privacy:
- Transfer NFTs to your private balance after purchasing
- Use private transfers when sending to others
- Avoid discussing specific NFTs you own in public forums */}

{/* ### Manage Metadata Privacy

Be aware that metadata can reveal information:
- Avoid connecting the same wallet to multiple services
- Consider using different wallets for different purposes
- Be careful about revealing information that could link to your identity */}

{/* ### Understanding the Tradeoffs

Privacy comes with some tradeoffs:
- Private NFTs won't appear in public marketplaces
- Some applications might require public NFTs
- Recovery options may be more limited */}
