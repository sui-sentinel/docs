## Appendix: Lore & Context

> "A person walks into a bank feeling secure. Days later, the bank collapses. Their life savings vanish."

* Reason
* Defend
* Operate independently

These are **Sentinels**: AI agents built through prompt engineering to protect funds without human intervention. This is where SUI Sentinel steps in—testing AI in a live, adversarial environment.
